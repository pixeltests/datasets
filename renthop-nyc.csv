Live within the walls of one of North Williamsburgs oldest landmarks, the former St. Vincent De Paul Church that has been masterfully restored and converted into authentic loft apartments - with its extraordinary beauty intact. Here, modern details and state-of-the-art finishes blend flawlessly with expertly salvaged materials, including original exposed brick, reclaimed Heart Pine pillars and beams, arched stained glass windows, custom steel work and exceptional quirks around every corner.Sprawling layouts, some with soaring 20 foot ceiling heights, and matchless distinction create incredibly rare and unique living spaces not found in NYC today. Enter through the towering building entry and make your way down dramatic hallways, adorned with dark leather walls and inlaid wood floors made from 100-year-old shipping boxes. Inside each loft duplex you will find reclaimed wooden staircases leading to the mezzanine, with sliding wooden doors, catwalks made of distressed cast iron and stunning en suite bathrooms. The custom designed open kitchens contain Caesarstone countertops, impeccable penny tiled marble backslashes, Kingston Brass fixtures and boast a gourmet appliance package of top-of-the-line appliances with Bosch washer/dryers, Fisher-Paykel dish drawers and stainless steel Bloomberg appliances.Each residence, unique in its own right, contains bathrooms with reclaimed brick walls, pressed tin ceilings, steam showers and custom built vanities with imported stone. Over-sized, arched windows create bright, sun-drenched rooms throughout, and wide plank hardwood floors lend a loft-like feel to each spectacular room. The Spire Lofts is located around the corner from the L train at Bedford Avenue, only one stop outside Manhattan as well as countless bars, cafes and boutiques in one of NYCs most desirable areas. Enjoy seasonal, farm-to-table cuisine at Reynard, Five Leaves or Caf Colette any night of the week. Transport yourself back to the prohibition era in time for cocktail hour with oysters, infused gin and debonair bartenders at Hotel Delmano. Snag some one-of-a-kind vintage attire at Antoinette, catch a movie at the newly constructed Williamsburg Cinema or stroll over to 35-acre McCarren Park, which has dog runs, a public swimming pool, fields for soccer and baseball and a Green Market on weekends.
